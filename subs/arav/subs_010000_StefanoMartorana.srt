01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:08,800
## supportive of individuals within 
## our network who are doing that uh




594
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:16,800
## i don't see that as activism though i don't see 
## that as like fighting a human rights cause of  




595
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:23,440
## some kind no i guess not but i guess it would be 
## raising awareness that homeless people need food  




596
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:28,640
## i know people know that or maybe inspiring other 
## vegans to go out and outreach homeless people and  




597
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,800
## give them food i don't know it's an idea it's 
## just it's just an idea as is what i mean it's  




598
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:37,840
## it's something that uh like i don't know if it 
## even would count as intersectionality in that  




599
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:42,800
## case but for example the lebanon example would 
## because they they have the corrupt government  




600
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:48,080
## they are they're oppressing their people um making 
## someone making a post or making a video on that  




601
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:51,120
## where you're saying hey look at what these 
## awesome vegans are doing they're fighting a  




602
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:55,360
## corrupt government and they're also saving animals 
## and they're getting people food that that would be  




603
01:00:55,360 --> 01:01:02,000
## a better example of of how to raise awareness of 
## two oppressions um in one without either of them  




604
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,240
## losing anything if that makes sense because 
## it's not like we're just talking about  




605
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:11,040
## you know lebanon we're talking about vegan and 
## activists in lebanon so like then it becomes  




606
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:16,320
## something that encompasses all of it you 
## know but i mean i i'm a bit confused because




607
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:27,040
## i don't see how it was like an animal rights 
## uh thing that they did they're just vegans  




608
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:32,720
## people who don't abuse and torture animals 
## animal rights activists who went and did  




609
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:42,560
## a deed for humans and that deed was a human rights 
## good that they did and when they were doing that  




610
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:48,960
## that act that deed had nothing to do with the 
## animals really it was just about i think david was  




611
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,360
## saying that they were kind of outreaching people 
## when they were giving them the food were they  




612
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:57,520
## yeah i believe they were i don't know 
## this for sure but i believe they were  




613
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,760
## sending out like leaflets and stuff with the 
## with the bags and also they were rescuing animals  




614
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,800
## too they were actually rescuing animals 
## off the street and getting them treated  




615
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:09,120
## they were raising money for that too so they 
## were doing a few yeah it was like uh it was  




616
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:13,360
## yeah they were doing a few a few different things 
## to try and help the animals and also the people  




617
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:19,360
## yeah i didn't know the full extent of the campaign 
## that they carried out over there uh i all i know  




618
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:23,360
## is at the time i reached out and you know i 
## checked in with them and i was just wanting to  




619
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:29,840
## know if they were okay during the whole blast but 
## i forgive my ignorance to those who were carrying  




620
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:35,840
## out that awesome campaign because it looked very 
## helpful i was just confused on how it was tied  




621
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:40,880
## into animal rights i just thought they were doing 
## a deed a good deed for humans at in that moment  




622
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,320
## i didn't see how maybe they were maybe they were 
## maybe they were maybe maybe they were only doing  




623
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:50,800
## that some of them um but i know for sure some 
## of them were also rescuing the animals i guess  




624
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:55,680
## i mean with a more concrete example if let's 
## imagine there is a concrete example of this  




625
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:00,800
## where they're actually doing that they're actually 
## advocating for animal rights whilst simultaneously  




626
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:07,760
## helping humans um i guess the question is like 
## would would that be something av would consider to  




627
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,960
## post about if it came up or or is is there some a 
## reason not to that's what i'm trying to understand  




628
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,600
## like hosting this you're asking specifically 
## about posting about it on social media  




629
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,800
## our platforms are for animal rights for non-human 
## animal rights so that's our general response to  




630
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:33,920
## that but we do carry out what you're saying we 
## do take the opportunity to how did you want it  




631
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,800
## to benefit humans while benefiting the 
## animals you know in those moments when we see  




632
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:42,400
## any form of oppression or discrimination 
## occurring within our organization  




633
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:48,960
## we stamp it out with the quickness and we have 
## a process that we go through to rid it from the  




634
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:54,160
## organization in those moments we're taking 
## action that benefits humans and the animals  




635
01:03:55,360 --> 01:04:00,400
## we're just not posting about it i guess because 
## our platforms and network is for non-human animals  




636
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:08,320
## okay i understand i understand so it's kind of 
## like um yeah so your base your base kind of um  




637
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:13,760
## i don't know what to put it here your 
## let's say default your your focus your  




638
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:20,800
## baseline i keep using that word is is that you 
## know the the account is for non-humans and that  




639
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:25,280
## that's kind of the be that's it basically that 
## that's how it's going to be like social media  




640
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:31,360
## and also the cubes it that that's where it's 
## going to stay and that that's your core kind  




641
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:36,800
## of value basically that's what you're saying here 
## right yeah like again going back to the numbers  




642
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:40,880
## thing you know three trillion animals every year 
## if you think about the amount of victims that are  




643
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:47,840
## involved in this injustice you know how many more 
## times uh more urgent would you say in terms of the  




644
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:54,400
## numbers this injustice is than other injustices 
## on the planet how many more times more urgent  




645
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:59,200
## would you say totally it's like it's not a it's 
## not a criticism for me i'm actually just trying  




646
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:06,960
## to uh you know clarify yeah no no maybe that was 
## framed like i was like being defensive but i'm
