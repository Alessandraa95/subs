01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:14,080
## it takes these people are supposed to care about 
## these injustices when they're literally spinning  




1047
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:22,720
## in the faces of the victims that are subjected 
## by those injustices when they do that definitely  




1048
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:31,120
## and move it on to the av racism claim the blm 
## post that was the uh the center of apparent  




1049
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:38,320
## uh racism you know this is the uh apparently that 
## post was in itself racist and and those it's gone  




1050
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:42,880
## now obviously but for those who didn't see it it 
## was the image the famous image that went around  




1051
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:49,600
## of a blm activist a black man holding a pig's 
## head by the ears a severed pig's head by the ears  




1052
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:58,160
## to protest against police brutality a navy av put 
## out a an image with the caption and that was it  




1053
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:02,800
## ended up causing so much controversy and claims 
## of racism and all these things and it and it was  




1054
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:07,520
## removed in the end right so like tell us the i 
## know you've done it before again i'm sorry you  




1055
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:11,200
## have to keep repeating yourself but you know we 
## are we're aiming to get through everything today  




1056
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:16,960
## but tell us the story behind that then and and you 
## know if you think that was racist as well and the  




1057
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:26,880
## reasons you removed it so it wasn't removed um 
## it wasn't removed you know as a result of like




1058
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:36,960
## so just to clarify it's still up on our instagram 
## it's only been removed on facebook because  




1059
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:44,240
## we stupidly took i want to say take the bet we 
## took the bait i don't know if that's the proper  




1060
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:50,800
## term to use here but whatever with regards to 
## what the donor was demanding of us at the time  




1061
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:58,160
## throughout the whole debacle that we went through 
## with the donor and uh so we made a decision  




1062
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:08,880
## to remove that post only because this 
## donor was learning to remove our funding um  




1063
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:15,120
## and it was it was the only thing that 
## we were willing to consider doing  




1064
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:22,240
## uh out of all the demands that they gave 
## us we completely rejected the notion of  




1065
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:28,960
## a board of directors and the other things we we 
## really push back on and we we try to be as as  




1066
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:35,840
## charitable and open to these demands as possible 
## which is why we deleted that post as a decision  




1067
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:43,280
## we made and at this point we had deleted it 
## probably a month and a half or two months  




1068
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:50,480
## after the post was made so at that point it had 
## it had seen most of its traction you know so  




1069
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:57,840
## uh i just want to clarify it wasn't removed 
## after getting heat from people in the comments  




1070
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:05,760
## section or anything like that it was uh it 
## was a post that we believe needs to happen  




1071
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:10,720
## it's just the way that we communicated in 
## that post that we felt we could improve  




1072
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:15,360
## on and we have already addressed this within 
## the organization because recently we saw the  




1073
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:20,640
## same thing happening at another protest 
## in spain and we made a post about that uh




1074
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:30,400
## it didn't you know it didn't get as much traction 
## but um you know so there's something to be said  




1075
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:34,400
## about being direct about these things but 
## it's unpopular we share a lot of unpopular  




1076
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:38,720
## opinions that's what we do because the 
## truth is unpopular at the best of times  




1077
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:48,480
## uh and yeah and uh we are committed to speak up 
## against animal oppression wherever we see it so  




1078
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:54,160
## if it's been if it's being paraded on the 
## on the main stage on in the mainstream on  




1079
01:48:54,160 --> 01:49:02,400
## the news every around the world as a appropriate 
## and acceptable way of addressing human um centric  




1080
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:09,920
## injustices you know to hold decapitated heads 
## up to to say [ __ ] the police uh then we have  




1081
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:16,160
## a responsibility to say something about that 
## um no oppression is acceptable ever no one  




1082
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:21,840
## has the right to oppress anyone else ever in any 
## situation ever and uh and that's supposed to be  




1083
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:27,680
## the ethos behind these protests that were 
## occurring this year and that's our ethos so  




1084
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:33,680
## we should be seeing eye to eye but uh yeah that's 
## really our responsibility to do that but yeah we  




1085
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:39,040
## remove that post um as a result of the donor and 
## we we regret that decision i don't know how else  




1086
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:43,760
## to say it but it's i mean we we still have it on 
## instagram it's not being removed from instagram so  




1087
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:52,000
## from that what you will sure sure so that's yeah 
## it clarifies a lot and and just to clarify here  




1088
01:49:52,000 --> 01:50:00,160
## like you don't you don't believe that post was 
## racist right no like what we said it could have
