846
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:08,320
## humans have been through so it's not something 
## that should be accepted um just because it's big  




847
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:13,680
## and because it's being pushed but at the same time 
## for good or for bad there are people out there who  




848
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:20,320
## uh yeah like specifically it is it is very much 
## intertwined with trends with the trans issues  




849
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:23,680
## which is why it keeps coming up and this you 
## didn't you said earlier i don't understand why  




850
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:27,760
## people keep saying it's about trans it's because 
## i feel i feel personally i don't tell me if i'm  




851
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:34,720
## wrong i feel like that that um i wouldn't say 
## popularity but the the more exposure let's say  




852
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:40,400
## the more awareness of trends and what it means 
## to be trans has also come tied in with gender  




853
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:47,520
## and and gender identity yeah because yeah confuse 
## the issue though i think deliberately they have to  




854
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:53,280
## use the two now it's like all mixed in but 
## it doesn't need to be because when we're  




855
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:58,640
## talking about gender pronouns and gender 
## we're talking about gender roles and like  




856
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:04,640
## you can you can be a female like you can be 
## born a female in a female body but you may  




857
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:13,360
## not necessarily feel like you are fitting into 
## that you know that i don't know mindset or that  




858
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,080
## gender role and that's totally fine but that's 
## not what we're talking about when we're talking  




859
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:23,040
## about like someone transitioning you're talking 
## about them changing their their body and that's  




860
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:28,880
## the sex it's like when you go to the doctor they 
## they care about knowing your birth sex because  




861
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:34,400
## you know the doctor needs about your body and your 
## biology so that's why sex and gender are different  




862
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:40,320
## and if anyone wants to confuse the two that's 
## just not gonna you know that's fine but that's  




863
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:48,720
## that's just not the reality of it they're they're 
## completely separate uh and my trans um supporters  




864
01:26:48,720 --> 01:27:00,720
## tell me this and and i agree with them convoluting 
## conflating gender politics uh the gender pronoun




865
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:10,640
## issue in society that's been brought up uh with 
## the trans movement and struggle of trans people  




866
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:17,040
## is actually diminishing them as victims of their 
## struggle so it takes away from what they're really  




867
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:21,440
## dealing with and uh they're not struggling 
## with gender pronouns necessarily like the  




868
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:24,880
## the struggles are different 
## they're they're struggling  




869
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:30,640
## with uh with just being accepted as a trans 
## person and that's a different discussion  




870
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:36,000
## completely to what we're discussing here this is 
## what they tell me and i agree with them and uh  




871
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:44,640
## it's disrespectful to the trans movement to just 
## attach all these other things to it and say that's  




872
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:52,400
## a trans issue too yeah if you care about the trans 
## movement then you wouldn't do that i understand so  




873
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:59,920
## yeah there's a distinction between just wanting 
## to identify as one of the limitless genders and  




874
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:05,520
## actually suffering from gender dysphoria and and 
## changing your sex and wanting to be referred to  




875
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:11,040
## as a different pronoun because it it validates who 
## you are and it's something that you have struggled  




876
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:15,600
## through yes you're drawing there's a distinction 
## between the two basically is what you're saying  




877
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:21,440
## right there absolutely is and trans people 
## around the world feel diminished because of this  




878
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:30,400
## this incessant um obsessive need to link it to 
## everything else and they've already finished on  




879
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:38,560
## top okay but it's but although although you hold 
## this belief and obviously av operates on this um  




880
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:44,000
## not belief i wouldn't say but let's say opinion 
## and the av operates also on this opinion like that  




881
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:50,640
## av will not accept um people bringing 
## in ideologies um without let's say  




882
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:55,840
## like obviously trans trend the trans movement 
## isn't an ideology um not for them not for the  




883
01:28:55,840 --> 01:29:00,640
## people who are actually uh you know suffering from 
## gender dysphoria anyway although there are people  




884
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:04,640
## who are calling themselves trans who are actually 
## not don't have gender dysphoria then that's an  




885
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:09,680
## ideology i would say that's different that's a 
## political um ideology or or some i don't know  




886
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:16,720
## ideology of some sort um but unfortunately i would 
## say it is it is difficult to actually determine  




887
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:22,480
## who is who right and and who is for real and who 
## is doing this because they genuinely you know are  




888
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:27,200
## a trans person and who is doing this because they 
## have they want to get on board with an ideology  




889
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:34,160
## and and kind of i don't know be different um i 
## guess how does av how does it how is av going  




890
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:39,680
## to operate with that because i know that you like 
## you've just said you'll you accept people who have  




891
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:44,560
## uh and you accept and will respect people 
## who are genuinely you know are trans or or  




892
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:48,720
## whatever if they have whatever condition the av 
## will respect them and people will be booted if  




893
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:53,680
## they don't respect them but then also in the same 
## breath you're saying that the political ideology  




894
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:58,400
## is not actually welcome and so if somebody isn't 
## actually trans and they are just identifying as  




895
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:03,760
## someone else because it's something they want 
## to do so how is av going to actually how would
