541
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:07,680
## in america during the protests in minnesota 
## and throughout other states said really  




542
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:13,120
## nothing about what happened in lebanon 
## for example yeah they are very selective  




543
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:21,440
## the causes that they choose to speak up about and 
## that's the thing because when people ask us to do  




544
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:29,280
## the same thing they're asking us to to speak up 
## for those specific issues um because you know how  




545
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:35,600
## many different things are out there that you could 
## be speaking about when it comes to human rights  




546
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:42,080
## there are so many different things and i don't 
## know anyone who claims to be an intersectional  




547
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:47,760
## and they actually cover all of those issues 
## there's literally thousands of different  




548
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:53,360
## things that you could talk about and i i only see 
## these people focusing on two or three different  




549
00:55:53,360 --> 00:56:00,160
## categories and they want us to do the same and 
## that points out that you do have to choose your  




550
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:05,040
## cause yeah because if they're claiming you 
## have to speak up for all of them well there's  




551
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:11,040
## literally thousands of injustices occurring 
## right now around the world all the time so  




552
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,480
## it's not only impractical it's impossible 
## for you to physically pull that off to  




553
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:24,160
## actually speak up for all of them yeah and to 
## fight to end all of them all at once i mean  




554
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:31,360
## think about how insane that is so these people are 
## being hypocrites because these people are choosing  




555
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:38,720
## their causes which is guess what we have you have 
## our support you have our full support to do that  




556
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:45,760
## because we chose a cause yeah and that's how it is 
## you guys are doing the same thing that we're doing  




557
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:50,720
## how about we i'm actually taking this moment 
## to see where we have something in common  




558
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:57,280
## and maybe you should do the same thing instead of 
## looking at where we have a difference or where you  




559
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:04,320
## think you're more holier than that or something 
## to that effect have you considered this before  




560
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:09,440
## there's a concept that actually if i i'll tell 
## you who who introduced me to it but um this was  




561
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,680
## actually back in the day when things were a little 
## bit nicer but it was actually anita who introduced  




562
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:19,840
## me to this concept um years like maybe a year and 
## a half ago two years ago when i i brought up the i  




563
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:24,000
## brought up some comments about insectionality and 
## i kind of warned anita that it looked like this  




564
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,960
## was going to start to take a turn for the worse 
## people were starting to attack me for not you know  




565
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,360
## saying certain things or for saying certain things 
## and i felt like it was starting to seep into  




566
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:39,520
## organizations and i mentioned this and she told me 
## we won't do this because we are all about positive  




567
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,840
## intersectionality and she had this concept and 
## this mindset and it really inspired me actually  




568
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:50,560
## because she said we can fight for the animals 
## 100 always but when there are situations where  




569
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:57,760
## it also benefits humans we can also note it for 
## example look these vegans went out and gave free  




570
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,880
## food that are homeless because they're suffering 
## they're doing animal rights activism by teaching  




571
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,600
## the homeless about veganism and they're helping 
## the homeless for example that would be a positive  




572
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:13,200
## intersectional message right it's not no one 
## loses out here the animals are focused and  




573
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:18,800
## the the homeless people have a focus in lebanon 
## for example with the blast the the vegans the  




574
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:24,800
## local vegans were doing incredible work they were 
## getting like food out to everyone they were like  




575
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:28,400
## you know um helping the vegan businesses in 
## the area they were helping the animals in the  




576
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:33,920
## area it was it was amazing but you're also raising 
## awareness of that corrupt government and how this  




577
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:39,360
## even happened in the first place it's it's two in 
## one it's easy right um and this was great when she  




578
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:43,360
## said this i was really inspired but obviously we 
## know how that went and it didn't end up staying  




579
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:48,480
## um staying that way unfortunately but for you guys 
## like what do you think about av in that sense do  




580
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:53,040
## you think this is something av could do like with 
## social media i mean not with the cubes but like  




581
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,640
## with how you represent yourselves on social 
## media is that something that you've thought about  




582
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:01,440
## or would ever consider or you do you have do 
## you disagree with that that kind of way of doing  




583
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:09,920
## things what way of doing things specifically 
## what is being suggested so so like for example  




584
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:16,480
## when there are some um when there is there are 
## issues that potentially could be both benefited by  




585
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:21,520
## raising awareness of it for example you obviously 
## av is 100 focused on the animals but let's imagine  




586
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:26,480
## there is uh some of your av organizers or 
## your av team goes out and gives food to the  




587
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,440
## homeless raising putting that on av social 
## media and saying like look look look at what  




588
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,520
## our awesome activists are doing they're fighting 
## for the animals and they're helping the homeless  




589
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,920
## do you see some pro a problem with doing something 
## like that or do you think that that you agree with  




590
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:48,720
## that as a as an idea that specific suggestion just 
## sounds like we would be i don't see how that helps




591
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:55,120
## a human cause of any kind 
## by making a post like that  




592
00:59:55,120 --> 01:00:02,880
## i don't see that as activism to help a human 
## cause i mean at best it's congratulatory and
