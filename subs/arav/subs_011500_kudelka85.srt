743
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:05,760
## but at the same time forcing others to believe 
## what you believe at the cube is not welcome  




744
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:12,400
## that's not what we're there for right everybody 
## has a different belief system when it comes  




745
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:16,720
## to this topic and people are entitled 
## to have different opinions about this  




746
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:25,040
## and that's it's not a time and a space at a cube 
## of truth to be fighting each other to be engaging  




747
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:31,040
## in this kind of discord when it's human-centric 
## and we are supposed to be there for non-human  




748
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:35,440
## animals we should be respecting each other 
## to have the right to have a different opinion  




749
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:39,280
## and to just get on with the one thing we're 
## supposed to be on the same page about which is  




750
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:45,680
## non-human animal rights deserve to have this three 
## or four hours dedicated to them on the streets  




751
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:52,400
## yeah i guess i guess to kind of close this 
## off or i hope we can close it off as if  




752
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,840
## so if if uh we have i mean obviously there 
## are there are obviously trans activists right  




753
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,920
## i'm focusing on trans here because i understand 
## what you're saying about gender pronouns in that  




754
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:06,880
## if somebody has chosen a pronoun because it's 
## whatever it's something they want to identify as  




755
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:11,840
## i understand why there's some some skepticism here 
## because it's kind of like all right that's fine  




756
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:17,600
## you'll go ahead and do that and people can 
## respect that but if if they forget or if they  




757
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:23,280
## i don't know if they don't want to and there's 
## no real logic behind the reason that the view  




758
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,880
## identifying is that i can understand why 
## someone you know not being into that but  




759
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:31,360
## where i'm specifically focusing on here and 
## and i'm focusing on it because it is it is  




760
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:35,040
## medical it is it is it is a psychological 
## thing it is not something that's like  




761
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:39,200
## opinion is that you know gender dysphoria 
## exists like trans people exist we have to




762
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,440
## time but now it's becoming more acceptable to 
## discuss it right so you see a lot more people  




763
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:51,040
## who are coming out this way whereas in the past 
## they wouldn't have done they would have hidden  




764
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:54,480
## it because they were embarrassed or ashamed and 
## they just go through their whole life with this  




765
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:59,360
## situation you know with this this problem nowadays 
## uh people are being encouraged to speak up about  




766
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:04,320
## it and you know go public and get the operation 
## and and re-identify themselves so that they're  




767
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:11,040
## more they are who they are right what i'm trying 
## to get here is that does does av have like uh  




768
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:16,560
## something in place that is also accommodating that 
## so that so that if somebody does come to a cube as  




769
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:24,320
## a trans person um and they want to be identified 
## as a he um or she or they if they're not sure um  




770
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:29,760
## and somebody is is you know if they get it wrong 
## by accident okay i get that that's something that  




771
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:34,000
## you know it shouldn't if it's a complaint you 
## just say okay hey please you know don't don't  




772
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,080
## get it wrong by accident in the future like do us 
## a favor but if if they're choosing to get it wrong  




773
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:44,960
## if they're like actually saying no i don't accept 
## that are you saying that yeah bullying yeah that  




774
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:49,440
## could that could be bullying yeah um but also i 
## kind of i'm kind of trying to understand where  




775
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:54,240
## the line's drawn between well that's your 
## ideology so tough [ __ ] versus well okay no  




776
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:58,640
## this is something that this is you this is who 
## you are and look this person needs to respect  




777
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:02,080
## that or or they're the one that'll be kicked 
## out like where are you where are you drawing  




778
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:07,280
## the line between the ideology versus the bullying 
## if you understand what i'm saying because maybe  




779
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:11,840
## an organizer says well i don't need to respect 
## that because i don't agree where's the line drawn




780
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:21,600
## the line is simply drawn at if the interaction 
## at the cube requires your gender then okay we'll  




781
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:27,840
## use whatever gender you choose us to use however 
## whatever name because in that case they can also  




782
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:33,440
## use the name if the organizer or the volunteer 
## feels uncomfortable or they don't align with the  




783
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:38,400
## same ideologies they don't have to use the pronoun 
## they can just refer to them with their chosen name  




784
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:44,320
## yeah that's what i was going to say is that the 
## interactions that you don't actually require  




785
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:50,400
## don't actually require the gender so that's what i 
## was saying is that if i'm trying to be charitable  




786
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:54,720
## and open-minded here by saying if there is 
## a circumstance of the cube that requires the  




787
01:18:54,720 --> 01:19:00,960
## gender and the interaction to be successful in 
## the communication sure no not using that would  




788
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:06,320
## be rude it would be bullying and when there's 
## no case at a cube of truth never within ab  




789
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:10,480
## where this has happened where we've bullied 
## people and said [ __ ] your beliefs that's  




790
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:16,080
## never happened it's just ridiculous to even 
## suggest that that has happened but you know  




791
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:22,480
## but it's not required that's what we're saying 
## it's not required it's it's yeah this this notion  




792
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:29,440
## that it is required is a new notion that's being 
## brought into a b it's never been required and um i  




793
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:37,440
## i think i know something that was brought up a 
## while ago was um people are suggesting that at the  




794
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:45,440
## start of the cube because we do a briefing right 
## when everyone's there getting ready to do the cube  




795
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:51,600
## somebody or maybe a few people suggested that 
## we do this like we go around and get people to  




796
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:58,960
## introduce themselves and choose their preferred 
## like announce their preferred pronoun and this  




797
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:04,480
## is something that brought was brought up to us 
## and that was our response because something like
