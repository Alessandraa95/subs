01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:12,640
## asking a genuine question because my next thing 
## i was going to say because i say that to say this




648
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:24,240
## like that's how much more urgent it is for us 
## to maintain a focus on using those platforms  




649
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:31,680
## for that reason so it's not you know okay yeah 
## totally i i don't i don't see it as a a negative  




650
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:36,000
## the reason i got into this this discussion now 
## is because i i personally i i see some benefit  




651
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,520
## in that for myself personally that's why i make 
## some of the videos i make where i talk about  




652
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:45,200
## vegans doing good work also for people i see some 
## benefit in it and and that's my choice but that  




653
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:50,320
## doesn't by default mean that your choice is wrong 
## and i think this is um it's very important for  




654
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:54,640
## anyone that watched this section and thinks oh but 
## you know but some people are going to agree with  




655
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:59,200
## you and they'll be like no keep keep the people 
## off right i just just keep keep it really really  




656
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,640
## focused and some people are going to agree with 
## me and say well there's no harm in doing this  




657
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:07,600
## and maybe it'll help and that's totally fine to 
## have different opinions um it doesn't mean one  




658
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:12,960
## of us is wrong and deserves to be cancelled and 
## the others are you know deserve to be celebrated  




659
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,600
## it's just you align with who you align with and if 
## you're aligned with paul and asylum this then you  




660
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:21,440
## great keep you do that for your page and 
## if you align with me then great you do  




661
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,200
## what i said and if you don't align with either of 
## us then i don't know alive with someone else and  




662
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:29,600
## do do that then it's it's not um this isn't a case 
## of being right or wrong i just wanted to see what  




663
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:37,040
## you thought about it on this specific example 
## the specific topic okay cool um let's let's uh  




664
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,880
## all right let's go to a more direct 
## thing then because i've got a few like  




665
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:48,640
## let's say more direct accusations direct uh rumors 
## and um we talked about humans quite a lot now and  




666
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:53,120
## actually um it's kind of shitty that i bring the 
## co-founders of anonymous for the voiceless on and  




667
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:57,680
## we just talk about people but um that's what we 
## came here for uh maybe we can do another live  




668
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:02,800
## stream where we actually get into the you know 
## into animal rights and activism and really you  




669
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:08,160
## know go for that i think that would be nice to do 
## um to kind of balance having to talk about this  




670
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:15,040
## for such a long time but um these 
## uh main accusations we've had and  




671
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:19,680
## this also comes in with the intersectionality and 
## also comes in with the things you just discussed  




672
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:26,000
## about your uh your policies um the number one 
## that came up multiple times was accusations of  




673
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,600
## transphobia and pronouns and you've dealt with 
## this uh obviously paul you've dealt with this  




674
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:37,040
## personally and you've spoken about this in other 
## places but we are gonna talk about it a bit here  




675
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:43,600
## and some specific questions and somebody's 
## asked the question uh well i'll go for like  




676
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,360
## the longer one actually there's a few questions 
## but this one's actually quite a well written one  




677
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:54,800
## so they said and they left av this individual 
## because um because apparently av was focusing on  




678
01:07:54,800 --> 01:08:00,000
## they said focusing on the animals instead of 
## encouraging respect between activists uh they said  




679
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,960
## that there was a situation where you guys decided 
## to call people by birth names rather than calling  




680
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:13,440
## people by their preferred pronouns and for them 
## this was extremely offensive and wrong um and the  




681
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:19,359
## discussion around the pronoun politics or what you 
## called uh i think you call it something like uh  




682
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:24,319
## identity politics um they found this to be 
## a lot of people i guess found this to be  




683
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:31,840
## controversial or controversial enough for them to 
## leave av or at least not go to cubes anymore so  




684
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:40,160
## i guess the question is um why why why is that 
## why is this decision been made to not use people's  




685
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:46,320
## pronouns and use their first names instead even 
## if they want to be referred to by a pronoun




686
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:57,920
## i guess i'll answer because there's our 
## main interaction yeah uh gender pronouns  




687
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:07,840
## are clearly ideological and uh we don't so 
## you're just specifically asking about the cubes  




688
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:14,639
## like in nab i guess yeah let's keep 
## it focused on like cubes av yeah so




689
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:29,920
## i've never like personally being asked to refer 
## to someone as a particular like name and uh  




690
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:35,119
## where where i've refused to call 
## them that name that's never happened  




691
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:43,440
## you know it's obviously the polite thing 
## to do to use the requested name of someone  




692
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:48,080
## but at cubes we don't even really need your name  




693
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:54,159
## so it makes no sense for us to apply 
## a protocol regarding one's gender  




694
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:02,160
## so we don't even have a protocol regarding 
## gender at all because it's not required it's
