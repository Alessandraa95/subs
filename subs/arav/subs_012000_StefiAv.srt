798
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:12,160
## that 100 takes away from what we're doing because 
## it's not necessary and it's irrelevant so to put  




799
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:18,400
## time aside 15 20 minutes for everyone to go around 
## and say my name is blah blah blah and this is my  




800
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:25,120
## preferred pronoun which is unnecessary because in 
## case we need to refer to you you let us know then  




801
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:30,800
## if we got it wrong you correct us that's fine we 
## can get on with our day um i know that that was  




802
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:36,000
## something that was brought up and i just wanted to 
## clarify that there are many other things that are  




803
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:49,360
## human-centric that we don't allocate our activism 
## our time to at the cubes to engaging in and so you  




804
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:57,200
## could use this same logic if you're claiming that 
## we are discriminatory towards those who have uh  




805
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:02,800
## again we've never even spoken about trans 
## people so i reject the notion of even  




806
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:09,600
## commenting on trans people people with gender 
## pronouns uh the same argument could be used  




807
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:17,120
## for uh not um honoring the custodians of the 
## land and saying something about like the original  




808
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:22,960
## custodians the land the aboriginals or or the 
## native americans depending on the of the region  




809
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:27,520
## that we're talking about here we don't do that at 
## the cubes either does that mean that we are also  




810
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:34,560
## racist or we're also colonial colonialists 
## or whatever the word is that's being tossed  




811
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:40,160
## around regarding that discrimination no of 
## course not because we're there for non-humans  




812
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:44,080
## and non-humans deserve a cause dedicated 
## to them that's what this comes down to  




813
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:50,800
## is if you think that we're being discriminatory 
## under that logic then you really just don't think  




814
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:57,440
## that animals deserve a cause solely dedicated to 
## them that's what we're disagreeing about yeah yeah  




815
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:02,800
## i guess i guess my my what i'm what i was trying 
## to get out of it here is try to get to clarify  




816
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:08,320
## what for 100 this which i think you have clarified 
## now is that like the the you know what you don't  




817
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:15,680
## want people you don't want to bring up um like 
## let's say identity politics into into cubing  




818
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:21,120
## you don't want it to become part of av you don't 
## want it to become part of an action or an event  




819
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:28,160
## um however if somebody has personal a personal 
## thing where they want to be referred to as  




820
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:34,160
## a certain pronoun or they've recently transitioned 
## that av is part of av policies to respect that  




821
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:38,320
## because not respecting that would be considered 
## bullying that's what i'm trying to clarify here  




822
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:43,120
## so this is you're making a distinction between the 
## two i also need to make the distinction here that  




823
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:50,480
## we're referring to sex if anything whenever the 
## word gender is being used in this conversation  




824
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:56,240
## we are not referring to anything other than 
## sex we are not referring our repeat to anything  




825
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:05,360
## other than sex and the conversation keeps getting 
## skewed by others to be referring to gender but uh  




826
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:12,160
## regarding trans issues or regarding this 
## whole thing uh with my comments on being  




827
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:17,920
## skeptical of gender pronouns it was regarding 
## sex that i was skeptical of this there aren't  




828
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:22,880
## more than two sexes in my opinion and i think 
## that people are entitled to have that opinion  




829
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:27,360
## trans people are transitioning between those 
## two sexes i think they have the right to do that  




830
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:33,200
## so i support the trans movement if that's what it 
## is right i have trans people that follow me that  




831
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:40,160
## support me that like me in the face of my comments 
## and the hate i receive getting called a transfer  




832
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:45,120
## does not waver these people i'm not trying to use 
## them as a token i'm just giving people context  




833
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:54,000
## because context is lost in our in our culture 
## and yeah that's all i have to say okay um




834
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:01,600
## yeah yes i'm trying to wrap my head around it 
## and also i just sorry i was just taking care of  




835
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:05,600
## a troll as well i'm just asking annie to get rid 
## of a troll in the chat as i was also trying to get  




836
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:12,000
## that sword it seems like they're bothering people 
## so you obviously you make a separation between um  




837
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:17,840
## sex and gender which i think most well i mean 
## that's just that's that's scientific um there  




838
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:23,120
## is there is actually i think um some people would 
## argue including myself that there are three sexes  




839
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:28,160
## because there's intersex which is very rare but 
## it exists right it's it's when someone's born with  




840
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:33,600
## both or like like you know both um genetics or 
## whatever i don't know too much about it but i  




841
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:38,560
## know that it exists um and then yeah and then and 
## then you're drawing the line because because um  




842
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:45,360
## yeah because genders it's a new it is an ideology 
## the ideology gender ideology is new it is new  




843
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:49,440
## if anyone's upset about this then i'm not sorry 
## because you need to do some research on this and  




844
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:55,760
## how realize how gender ideology is a very recent 
## thing and it hasn't been put through the rigorous  




845
01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:01,840
## testing that most other psychological and science 
## scientific you know concepts have you know about
