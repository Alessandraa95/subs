## been communicated better um and that's why before 
## we removed it we actually went in and edited the  




1090
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:13,120
## post a little bit so we changed the wording 
## in certain parts um so that there was more  




1091
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:21,840
## empathy or you know it didn't come across as 
## insensitive like you said but absolutely no  




1092
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:28,480
## it wasn't yes so i think i think that's that's a 
## a wider issue really isn't it insensitivity versus  




1093
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:35,680
## uh versus racism or or whatever ism you want to 
## attach it's uh it's not bigoted to be insensitive  




1094
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:43,120
## um it's some people are i don't know harsher than 
## others and i think um on a personal level i think  




1095
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:48,320
## i think that's where a lot of the criticisms and 
## accusations come from with av i don't think it's  




1096
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:54,800
## uh i think it is that our movement is quite a 
## sensitive movement with very sensitive people and  




1097
01:50:55,360 --> 01:51:01,200
## av isn't isn't very sensitive and that's that's 
## not i don't mean that as a criticism at all i mean  




1098
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:05,840
## that as in some people don't like that and that's 
## that's you know that's where we get a lot of  




1099
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:10,320
## a lot of people who come up and speak up about 
## it whereas if you look at an organization like  




1100
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:15,120
## save for example they're the complete opposite 
## side they're extremely sensitive and so they  




1101
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:20,400
## attract a lot of people who are uh you know also 
## extremely sensitive which happens to be the vast  




1102
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:27,280
## majority of of the animal rights movement and the 
## vegan movement people tend to be very sensitive  




1103
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:32,320
## in these groups so you know i can see i can see 
## where the accusations come flying in from but um  




1104
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:38,160
## i think if they were accusing you of insensitivity 
## and and being too mean i think that would  




1105
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:44,720
## probably be not as nowhere near as harmful as 
## throwing the word racist at every turn you know  




1106
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:49,120
## that's my observation anyway that's 
## what i'm observing from the outside  




1107
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:54,480
## and this kind of track this this continues 
## really with the social media people have  




1108
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:58,320
## been upset by your social media quite a lot and i 
## know some of these examples are going to be very  




1109
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:03,760
## easy to discuss but we'll start off with the most 
## difficult one just to uh kick it off with this um  




1110
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:10,480
## i want to discuss the whole uh the whole hitler 
## thing and george because a few people asked me  




1111
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:14,880
## about this they asked me about george they asked 
## me about this post this this uh which obviously  




1112
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:20,160
## i know you removed it um but they kind of 
## want to know how it got to the point where  




1113
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:24,720
## someone in the organization would think about 
## making a post a comment like that and kind of  




1114
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:30,880
## what you guys think about it so if again for those 
## who don't know there was the um there was a post  




1115
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:36,000
## made i believe it was it was avs page as well 
## wasn't it on facebook it was a comment um where  




1116
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:42,080
## the comment was talking about hitler and it was 
## comparing hitler and the it was saying basically  




1117
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:46,720
## out of context here by the way completely out 
## of context and i've not got the screenshot so  




1118
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:51,200
## i'm not going to put it up but out of context 
## it was making a comparison and saying that the  




1119
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:59,760
## holocaust that hitler did had more justification 
## than the holocaust of the animals i'm paraphrasing  




1120
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:03,760
## here it was put into a better context than 
## that but that's that was the takeaway message  




1121
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:08,720
## that it was it had more justification because a 
## book was written about it practically or have i  




1122
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:13,120
## missed a big point there but either way that 
## seemed to be the takeaway point from it um  




1123
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:19,200
## out of context and that was obviously posted by i 
## believe george in the in the organization on as av  




1124
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:24,160
## so like what happened with this have i got 
## that wrong have people got that wrong and yeah




1125
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:31,040
## he's not saying that he wasn't saying 
## like legitimate justifications were  




1126
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:39,840
## were afoot in those cases he was saying that more 
## reasons were provided by hitler and his regime  




1127
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:46,480
## to the public then then the re then then what 
## non-vegans offer to the public regarding the  




1128
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:51,920
## injustice that they're involved in that's what he 
## was saying but the way that he said it lacked eq  




1129
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:58,240
## you got to have iq george is a smart guy but you 
## got to have eq2 you got to read the room and not  




1130
01:53:58,240 --> 01:54:03,360
## be an idiot about how you communicate emotionally 
## uh so that's the thing it wasn't clear enough  




1131
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:06,880
## the communication we identified as something 
## that needs to be improved and that's why we  




1132
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:16,320
## addressed the whole blm post to begin with uh the 
## way that we did it was about the communication  




1133
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:21,440
## and we still feel justified in 
## addressing what we addressed  




1134
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:30,800
## and we will continue to do so but um i think 
## you know sometimes yeah the issue there was um  




1135
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:39,680
## sometimes there is bias that's brought into 
## the work that people are doing within ab  




1136
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:46,640
## they bring their own biases whether they're 
## political or otherwise in the way they communicate  




1137
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:52,000
## and people need to remember if they're working 
## with av they're representing ap just like  




1138
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:57,680
## with any other org or group that they're 
## working with and when you're representing us




1139
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:05,520
## we don't want that and you know he also 
## did admit to doing this himself um so
